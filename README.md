# SpaceX Launch Analysis - Data Science Project

![Space Banner](./images/spacex_banner.jpg)

> A complete **end-to-end data science project** analyzing SpaceX launches – from data collection to machine learning prediction.  
> Developed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone**, and enhanced for real-world showcase.  
> 🌌 _Unveiling insights behind rocket missions!_

## Project Objectives

- Collect and wrangle SpaceX launch data from multiple sources (CSV, API, Web)
- Perform exploratory data analysis and data visualization
- Work with SQL for querying datasets
- Geolocate launch sites and visualize them on maps
- Engineer features and prepare data for modeling
- Train and evaluate classification models to predict successful launches
- Deliver insights via visual storytelling
